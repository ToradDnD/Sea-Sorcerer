		<description>
			<p>Dragons are beings of pure magic and therefore some wizards get heavily interested in them. Fascinated by the might of these majestic creatures, their flight and the devastation their breath weapons cause the Draconic Mage focuses all his studies to understand the dragon – how it fights, how to beat it, and how to emulate its fighting techniques using the arcane.
The Draconic mage adapts different aspects of the dragon over the course of his career. However, developing these dragon aspects takes a lot of magical power, and a human will never fully be able to adapt the powers of a dragon.

		<description><p>
			You strive to emulate the resilience and superior defense of a dragon. While dragons are strong and mighty because of their size, their inherent magic gives them additional defenses and the magic properties of draconic scales are powerful in their own right. You learned to weave some of the dragons defense into your own essence. 
You can use a bonus action gain temporary hitpoints equal to your wizard level+ your intelligence modifier for up to one minute. Once you do so, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

		<description><p>
			While dragons are majestic and invoke awe by their image alone, a lot of their impressive presence and influence on lesser minds comes from magic which you can emulate. As an action, you can choose 1 creature within 30ft of you and force it to make a wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. If it fails it is frightened or charmed by you until the end of your next turn. You cannot use this feature on that creature again until you finish a short or long rest. 
<p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<li>	<strong>1Point (max 1 time)</strong>: The duration increases to 1 minute. Affected creatures can repeat their saving throw at the end of each of their turns. </li>
<li>	<strong>1Point (max 3 times)</strong>: The range increases by 30ft.</li>
<li>	<strong>1Point</strong>: The ability can target one additional creature.</li>
<li>	<strong>2Points (max 1 time)</strong>: You can use the ability as a bonus action.</li>
<li>	<strong>2Points</strong>: The saving throw becomes Charisma or Intelligence (your choice when you take this feature).</li>

		<description><p>
			Dragons are mystic creatures, and there is so much to learn about how they shaped the world. You learn draconic (or another language if you already know it) and you gain proficiency in one knowledge skill (history, arcana, religion, nature) of your choice. In addition you are proficient and can double your proficiency bonus (=expertise) for any rolls that relate to recollecting knowledge about dragons.
<p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<li>	<strong>1 Point (max 3 times)</strong>: You gain proficiency in one knowledge skill.</li>
<li>	<strong>1 Point (max 4 times)</strong>: You gain expertise in 1 knowledge skill.</li>
<li>	<strong>1 Point (max 1 time)</strong>: Your research about dragons helps you in working together with them and understanding them. You gain advantage on any social checks in regard to dragons.</li>
<li>	<strong>1 Point</strong>: Your research about dragons physiology helps you both in helping and harming them. Whenever you use a healers kit on a wounded creature of the dragon type you can heal it for 1d6 hitpoints. Whenever you hit a creature of the dragon type the damage increases by 2.</li>
<li>	<strong>1 Point (max 2 times)</strong>: Your research about breath weapons allows you to counteract them. When you are affected by a breath weapon, after you roll the saving throw you can use your reaction to spend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. You gain a bonus to the saving throw equal to the level of the spell slot, and the damage you take is reduced by 5* the level of the spell slot.</li>
<li>	<strong>1 Point (max 4 times)</strong>: Your research about flying creatures allows you to fight them effectively. When you damage a creature with a fly speed its fly speed is reduced by 5ft for 1 hour if it fails a DEX Save against your spell save DC. A creature can only have his movement reduced by this feature once per turn. If you choose this feature again the reduction increases by 5ft and each creature can be affected one additional time per turn. </li>
